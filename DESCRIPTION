Description:
    The `anomalize` package enables a "tidy" workflow for detecting anomalies in data.
    The main functions are `time_decompose()`, `anomalize()`, and `time_recompose()`.
    When combined, it's quite simple to decompose time series, detect anomalies,
    and create bands separating the "normal" data from the anomalous data.
